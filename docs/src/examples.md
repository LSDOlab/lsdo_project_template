# Examples

Unlike tutorials, examples can also be generated from Python files (.py) in addition
to Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb),
and is more of a collection of run scripts for reference/benchmarking.
Examples may contain documentation in the form of comments.
However, outputs/visualization from running the script is excluded if you are using Python files.
